        <h2 class="section-heading">Luna Fete 2017</h2>
          <p> Constellations was an animated, interactive celestial skyscape - a cosmic orchestra of light and sound - that debuted at Luna Fete 2017. In this incarnation of the Kirasu universe, participantsâ€™ bodies were tracked and transformed into constellations, illuminating the night sky and entangling motion with the stars. The current installation was just one of an infinite number of potential materializations inspired by philosophical musings on the unknown and on what lies beyond.
